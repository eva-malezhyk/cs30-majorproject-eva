# For this project we would like to create a 2D cafe adventure game inspired by “Papa’s Pizzeria” game. We would like to create this game with mostly Javascript using the knowledge that we received from class and from learning many more Javascript functions. Additionally we can use HTML and CSS functions that will enrich the game's visual appeal and help us bring our idea into reality. 


## Needs To Have List:

- Npc giving order to the player
- Character can take orders from the npc
- Multiple different stations where the character can cook, build, prepare, etc.
- Character can interact with objects
- Basic animation
- A variable that shows how much money the character has

## Nice To Have List:

- Sprites
- Sound effects 
- Npc’s giving a percentage of how accurate was the order
- Being able to change character’s skins
- Having ‘special’ guests 
- Providing unlockable recipes, items, or character customization options as players progress through the game
